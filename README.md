# GEBuddy
This project is an attempt at creating a react application and back end (via express) that will give users the ability to record their sales and pruchases in OSRS Runescape. There is also going to be an option to record monster run drops. This application will make use of the OSRS GE API to get lists of items, their current pricing information, images, graphs, and general item details. Users will then be able to keep track of profits they have made through Grand Exchange merchanting and from their monster runs.
The project is still in its basic first steps.
